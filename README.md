# Sider - A demo Redis implementation in Rust

This project contains the code explained in the book [Rust Projects - Write a Redis Clone](https://leanpub.com/rustprojects-redis).

The implementation stages come from the amazing challenge "Build your own Redis" by [CodeCrafters](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/redis/overview).
